I have made my Portfolio project using Python, Django, HTML, CSS and bootstrap.
I have used Sqlite as well
I have connected it to my local database as if someone tried to contact me then they have to give their details in the form which opens afer clicking on contact us option.
When the user enter their details in the form and submit then those details will get appended to my local database.
I hope you like this project. Thanks :)
